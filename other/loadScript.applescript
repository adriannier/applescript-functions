	Version 6
	
	Example 1 - Loading a local script:
	loadScript("/path/to/script.applescript")
	
	Example 2 - Loading a local script with an online fallback:
	loadScript({scriptPath:"/path/to/script.applescript", scriptURL:"https://domain.com/path/to/script.applescript"})
	
	Loads an AppleScript file compiling it first if necessary.
	
	Specified path can be:
	
	- single file name 
	  --> file assumed in same directory as current script
	  
	- single file name prefixed with ./ 
	  --> file assumed in same directory as current script
	  
	- relative POSIX path prefixed with one or more ../ 
	  --> file assumed at relative path
	  
	- relative POSIX path starting with ~/ 
	  --> file assumed relative to home directory
	  
	- full HFS-style path
	
	- full POSIX path
	
	Version history
